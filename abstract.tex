\subsection*{Introduce topic and why its important}
Helicopters being hit by lightning is a real threat faced by many offshore personnel in the winter months. This study assesses the available theoretical explanations to this phenomenon and looks at the meteorological situation when such an incident has occurred.

\subsection*{Introduce a challenge or unresolved issue that you will try and solve.} 
The current forecasting algorithm does not always show high risk when helicopters are being hit by lightning or static discharges. It has been reported to show high risk when no meteorological phenomena related to risk are present.

\subsection*{What have you done to try and solving this.}
This thesis investigate the parameters being used in forecasting \acrfull{htl}, and tries to verify the algorithm with use of cases of lightning strikes to aircraft. 


\subsection*{The implications in the context of 1+2.}
The error in the forecast has given a overforecasting along coastal areas, where the vertical velocity and temperature part of the forecast often was present. This caused a possible overestimation of risk.
